Here’s a **different Mars mission report** with new goals, nodes, priorities, and hazards, but the **same structure**, so you can use it directly to test your pipeline.

# 🪐 Mars Mission Report

## 🧪 Scientific Goals

* Investigate mineral composition in **rocky terrain** near nodes **N14** and **N27**.
* Survey potential subsurface water traces in **icy terrain** at nodes **N41** and **N42**.
* Perform high-resolution aerial imaging of **crater terrain** at node **N66**.
* Monitor atmospheric dust density in **sandy terrain** at node **N18**.

---

## ⚙️ Operational Constraints

* **Rovers** must avoid prolonged operation when energy falls below 10%.
* **Drones** are required to complete all flights within their maximum operational range.
* **Satellites** must periodically relay telemetry data through the primary communication node.
* **No autonomous vehicle** may enter regions marked as geologically unstable or environmentally hazardous.

## 🎯 Mission Priorities

1. **High Priority**

   * Subsurface water survey at **N41–N42**
   * Atmospheric dust monitoring at **N18**

2. **Medium Priority**

   * Mineral composition analysis at **N14** and **N27**

3. **Low Priority**

   * Crater imaging at **N66**

---

## ⚠️ Known Hazards

* **Node N21**: unstable subsurface layers
* **Node N47**: elevated radiation readings
* **Node N58**: persistent dust storm activity

If you want, next I can:

* Produce an **edge-case report** (missing priorities, vague terrain),
* Generate a **drone-only** or **rover-only** mission,
* Or create a **stress-test report** designed to break assumptions in your crews.
