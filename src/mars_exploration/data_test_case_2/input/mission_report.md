# 🪐 Mars Mission Report

## 🧪 Scientific Goals

* Investigate mineral composition in **rocky terrain** near nodes **N14** and **N27**.
* Survey potential subsurface water traces in **icy terrain** at nodes **N41** and **N42**.
* Perform high-resolution aerial imaging of **crater terrain** at node **N66**.
* Monitor atmospheric dust density in **sandy terrain** at node **N18**.

## ⚙️ Operational Constraints

* **Rovers** must avoid prolonged operation when energy falls below 10%.
* **Drones** are required to complete all flights within their maximum operational range.
* **Satellites** must periodically relay telemetry data through the primary communication node.
* **No autonomous vehicle** may enter regions marked as geologically unstable or environmentally hazardous.
