# Mars Mission Strategy
## Mission Overview
The Mars Mission is a planetary exploration mission aimed at collecting scientific data and samples from various locations on the Martian surface. The primary objectives are to analyze ice composition, collect subsurface samples, measure radiation levels, and capture panoramic images.

##  Mission strategy

### Goal 1: Collect Subsurface Samples (SG1)
- **Step 1:** Rover travels to node N12.
- **Step 2:** Rover collects subsurface samples using its drilling equipment at node N12.
- **Step 3:** Rover proceeds to node N45 and collects subsurface samples.
- **Step 4:** Rover then travels to node N78 and collects subsurface samples.

### Goal 2: Analyze Ice Composition (SG2)
- **Step 1:** Drone flies over node N22 to analyze ice composition using its high-resolution camera.
- **Step 2:** Drone then flies over node N23 to analyze ice composition.

### Goal 3: Measure Radiation Levels (SG4)
- **Step 1:** Rover travels to node N90 to measure radiation levels in sandy terrain.
- **Step 2:** Rover measures radiation levels using its equipment.

### Goal 4: Capture Panoramic Images (SG3)
Unfortunately, due to a lack of suitable drones, this goal cannot be completed as planned. However, the mission will still achieve significant scientific value through the completion of other goals.

## Operational Constraints and Risks
- **Rovers:** Must recharge if energy drops below 30%.
- **Drones:** Must return to base after 25 minutes of flight.
- **Satellites:** Must maintain communication with base station at N1 every 2 hours.
- **Terrain Restrictions:** No agent may operate in terrain classified as unstable or radioactive.

## Coordination between Rover and Drone Activities
The rover and drone activities are coordinated to maximize mission efficiency, parallelism, and robustness. The rover is used for collecting subsurface samples and measuring radiation levels, while the drone is used for analyzing ice composition. The drone's flight path is planned to avoid conflicts with the rover's movement.

## Conclusion
The Mars Mission will successfully complete its primary objectives, providing valuable scientific data and samples. Although Goal SG3 cannot be completed due to a lack of suitable drones, the mission's overall success is not compromised.
