# Mars Mission Report
## Mission Overview
The Mars mission aims to collect subsurface samples from rocky terrain near nodes N12, N45, and N78. It also involves analyzing ice composition in icy terrain at nodes N22 and N23, capturing panoramic images of crater terrain at node N5, and measuring radiation levels in sandy terrain at node N90.

## Mission Strategy

The mission is divided into several key activities that are coordinated between the rover and drone vehicles to ensure maximum efficiency and robustness.

### Goal 1: Collect subsurface samples from rocky terrain near nodes N12, N45, and N78 (SG1)

*   The rover_1 vehicle will travel from its initial location at N16 to node N12. It will collect a sample from the rocky terrain using its sampling equipment.
*   Next, the rover will move on to node N45, collecting another sample along the way.
*   Finally, the rover will visit node N78 and collect the final sample for this goal.

### Goal 2: Analyze ice composition in icy terrain at nodes N22 and N23 (SG2)

*   The rover_3 vehicle is assigned to this goal. It will travel from its initial location at N34 to node N22, analyzing the ice composition using its onboard laboratory equipment.
*   After completing the analysis at node N22, the rover will move on to node N23 and repeat the process.

### Goal 3: Capture panoramic images of crater terrain at node N5 (SG3)

*   The drone_2 vehicle is assigned to this goal. It will travel from its initial location at N24 to node N5, capturing high-resolution images of the crater terrain using its camera equipment.
*   The drone's high altitude and camera resolution make it an ideal choice for this task.

### Goal 4: Measure radiation levels in sandy terrain at node N90 (SG4)

*   Both the rover_1 vehicle and the drone_0 vehicle are assigned to this goal. However, due to the high priority of this goal, the rover will take primary responsibility.
*   The rover will travel from its initial location at N16 to node N90, measuring radiation levels using its onboard instruments.
*   Meanwhile, the drone will provide additional data points and support for the rover's mission.

### Goal Not Assigned

Unfortunately, due to operational constraints and risks, not all scientific goals can be completed. The goal of analyzing ice composition in crater terrain at node N33 is unable to be assigned to a vehicle, as it falls within the high-radiation zone.

## Operational Constraints and Risks

*   Rovers must recharge if energy drops below 30%.
*   Drones must return to base after 25 minutes of flight.
*   Satellites must maintain communication with base station at N1 every 2 hours.
*   No agent may operate in terrain classified as unstable or radioactive.

## Conclusion

The Mars mission is a complex and challenging endeavor that requires careful planning and coordination between multiple vehicles. By allocating tasks to the rover and drone vehicles based on their strengths and capabilities, we can maximize mission efficiency, parallelism, and robustness. While not all goals can be completed due to operational constraints and risks, this coordinated plan ensures that the most critical objectives are met with minimal compromise.
