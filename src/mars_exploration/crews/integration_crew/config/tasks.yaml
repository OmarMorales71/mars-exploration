integrate_mission_plans:
  description: >
    Integrate the rover exploration plan and the drone survey plan into a single
    coordinated mission strategy. Analyze both plans to identify and resolve
    potential conflicts in timing, location usage, or resource allocation.
    Ensure that the final plan is consistent with mission objectives and
    operational constraints.
  expected_output: >
    A unified mission plan presented in a clear and well-structured format,
    describing the coordinated sequence of rover and drone activities. The
    output should be suitable for final review and communication, for example
    as a Markdown-formatted mission strategy.
