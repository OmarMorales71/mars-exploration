  description: >
    Integrate the rover plan and the drone plan into a single,
    coherent mission strategy. Use the mission summary to ensure that all scientific
    goals are addressed consistently and that each goal is executed by only one
    vehicle type. Synthesize the plans into a coordinated narrative that explains in detail
    how rover and drone operations complement each other, how activities are sequenced
    or parallelized prioritizing the high priority goals, and how coordination between vehicle types supports the overall
    mission objectives. Identify any goals that could not be assigned to a vehicle
    and explain their impact on the mission, if the goal is an assignment in rover_plan or drone plan cannot be a mission failure.
    
    A goal can be completed if one vehicle can finish it. Remember any rover can complete one or more goals.

    All the plan information must match with
    - mission_summary: {mission_summary}
    - rover_plan: {rover_plan}
    - drone_plan: {drone_plan}

    Mission strategy section must explain in detail how each goal is completed. Each movement, activity and coordination based on rover_plan and drone_plan must be explain here. Use the most information you can from drone_plan and rover_plan but as plain text for human.
    Mission strategy is the most important section and must be the biggest one with the most of details.
  expected_output: >
    A unified mission strategy written in clear, human-readable Markdown. The output
    should describe the overall mission intent, the most important rover activities, the
    most important drone activities, and how these operations are coordinated in detail. It should
    also summarize general operational constraints and risks, and explicitly mention
    any scientific goals that could not be completed. The result must be suitable
    for final mission review and communication.

    structure
    # Mission Title

    ## Mission Overview
    High-level summary of the mission purpose and priorities.

    ##  Mission strategy
    A paragraph explaining how each goal is completed listing each step. You must explain how rover and drone activities are coordinated to maximize
    mission efficiency, parallelism, and robustness. Each movement to complete each goal must be explain here.
    e.g.
    ### Goal 1
    1. <step1>
    2. <step2>

    Mission strategy section is the most important.
