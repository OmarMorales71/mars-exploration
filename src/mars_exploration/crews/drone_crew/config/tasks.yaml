clean_mission_for_drones:
  description: >
    You will receive a mission summary in JSON format. Your task is to extract and return
    only the information relevant to aerial drone operations. Keep exclusively the
    scientific goals that can be executed by drones, meaning goals that can be completed with a camera 
    and not collecting any sampling like aerial survey, reconnaissance, imaging, or observation. 
    Remove any goals that are rover-only (e.g., subsurface sampling, drilling, ground sampling) or satellite-only
    (orbital communication/relay constraints). For each retained goal, include its id,
    description, target_nodes, terrain, and priority, normalizing priority values to
    exactly one (in lowercase) of: high, medium, or low. For constraints, always include drone-specific
    constraints and always include any global constraint that applies to all agents
    (e.g., statements starting with “No agent …”, “All agents …”, or “No one …”), because
    these constraints also restrict drone operations. Also retain only hazards relevant to
    aerial navigation or flight safety, such as dust storms, radiation zones, or restricted
    terrains that drones must avoid.

    Input:
    - mission_summary: {mission_summary}

  expected_output: >
    Return valid JSON only, with no markdown or explanatory text. The output must contain
    exactly three top-level fields: drone_goals, constraints, and hazards. The drone_goals
    field must be an array of scientific goals executable by drones, where each goal
    includes id, description, target_nodes as an array, terrain as a string, and
    priority normalized to one of high, medium, or low. The constraints field must include
    all drone-specific constraints and all global constraints that apply to all agents whenever
    they appear in the mission summary, and the hazards field must list only hazards relevant to
    aerial navigation or flight safety. Do not include any additional fields or wrap arrays as strings.
