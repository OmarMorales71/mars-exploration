plan_drone_surveys:
  description: >
    Generate an aerial survey plan for the Mars exploration mission. Analyze the
    mission objectives and priorities together with the terrain map and drone
    capabilities. Define drone flight paths that cover high-priority observation
    areas while respecting constraints such as flight range, altitude limits,
    and sensor capabilities.
  expected_output: >
    A structured description of planned drone survey missions, including selected
    survey areas, flight paths or sequences, and the purpose of each survey.
    The output should be clearly organized and suitable for integration with
    rover plans during the mission coordination phase.
