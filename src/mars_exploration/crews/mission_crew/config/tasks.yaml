  description: >
    Read the mission report provided in Markdown format and identify all information
    required for autonomous mission planning. Extract the mission's scientific goals,
    operational constraints, mission priorities, and known or potential hazards.
    Interpret implicit requirements and assumptions where necessary, and highlight any
    uncertainties that may affect downstream planning.

    Mission report content:
    {mission_report}

  expected_output: >
    A mission analysis that is complete, internally consistent, and directly usable by
    downstream planning agents. It must capture the mission’s scientific goals,
    operational/environmental constraints, mission priorities that must be part of each scientific goal and normalized to one of high, medium, or low, and hazards relevant
    to both surface and aerial operations. Any inferred items must be clearly marked as
    assumptions, and any ambiguous, conflicting, or missing information must be flagged
    as planning risks or open issues.
