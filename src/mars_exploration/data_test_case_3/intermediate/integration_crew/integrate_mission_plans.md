# Mars Mission Report
## Mission Overview
The primary objective of this mission is to conduct a comprehensive exploration of the Martian surface while ensuring the efficient allocation of resources. This report outlines a unified mission strategy that integrates rover and drone plans to achieve all scientific goals.

## Mission Strategy

To maximize efficiency, we will prioritize high-priority goals (Goal 2: Survey subsurface water traces in icy terrain at nodes N41 and N42 and Goal 4: Monitor atmospheric dust density in sandy terrain at node N18) by assigning them to specific rovers. Rover_2 is tasked with surveying subsurface water traces near nodes N41 and N42, while rover_1 will monitor atmospheric dust density at node N18.

The mission begins with the deployment of rover_2 to node N43, where it travels 119 km (distance) to reach nodes N41 and N42. Upon arrival, rover_2 conducts mineral spectroscopy in icy terrain. To optimize energy usage, rover_1 is deployed to node N16, then travels 55 km (distance) to reach node N18.

Meanwhile, the drone fleet attempts to complete Goal 3: Perform high-resolution aerial imaging of crater terrain at node N66 but fails due to exceeding flight-time limits or lack of feasible routes. As a result, this goal is left unfulfilled and will be addressed in future missions.

Rover_4 is assigned to conduct mineral spectroscopy near nodes N14 and N27, traveling 137 km (distance) through rocky terrain. To maintain balance across rover usage, rover_2 is reassigned after completing its initial task, allowing rover_4 to focus on Goal 1.

During the mission, drones perform surveillance tasks in parallel with rovers' primary objectives. Drilling operations and sampling are coordinated between rovers to ensure efficient execution of scientific goals while maintaining a robust communication network.

### Goal 2

- **Step 1:** Rover_2 deploys to node N43.
- **Step 2:** Travel 119 km (distance) through the path [N43, N61, N54, N41, N54, N42, N54, N61, N43] to reach nodes N41 and N42.
- **Step 3:** Conduct mineral spectroscopy in icy terrain at nodes N41 and N42.

### Goal 4

- **Step 1:** Rover_1 deploys to node N16.
- **Step 2:** Travel 55 km (distance) through the path [N16, N90, N18, N90, N16] to reach node N18.
- **Step 3:** Monitor atmospheric dust density at node N18.

### Goal 1

- **Step 1:** Rover_4 deploys to node N16.
- **Step 2:** Travel 137 km (distance) through the path [N16, N14, N15, N28, N53, N27, N92, N18, N90, N16] to reach nodes N14 and N27.
- **Step 3:** Conduct mineral spectroscopy in rocky terrain near nodes N14 and N27.

## Goal 3: Perform High-Resolution Aerial Imaging of Crater Terrain at Node N66

Unfortunately, due to the limitations of drone flight times or lack of feasible routes, this goal remains unfulfilled. The mission team recognizes that aerial imaging is crucial for surface studies but acknowledges that it may require additional resources and planning in future missions.

**Mission Summary:**
- **Scientific Goals:** Conduct mineral spectroscopy in rocky terrain near nodes N14 and N27 (Goal 1), Survey subsurface water traces in icy terrain at nodes N41 and N42 (Goal 2), Monitor atmospheric dust density in sandy terrain at node N18 (Goal 4).
- **Operational Constraints:** Rovers should avoid traveling with less than 15% of energy, drones are limited to short-duration missions, satellites periodically relay mission telemetry.
- **Hazards:** Node N21: unstable subsurface layers, Node N47: intermittent radiation spikes, Node N60: severe dust storm activity.

By prioritizing resource allocation and coordinating between rovers and drones, we have successfully executed this Mars exploration mission. The comprehensive understanding of the Martian surface gained will pave the way for future scientific breakthroughs.
