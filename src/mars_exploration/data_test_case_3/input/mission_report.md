# 🪐 Mars Mission Report

## 🧪 Scientific Goals

* Conduct mineral spectroscopy in **rocky terrain** near nodes **N14** and **N27**.
* Survey subsurface water traces in **icy terrain** at nodes **N41** and **N42**.
* Perform high-resolution aerial imaging of **crater terrain** at node **N66**.
* Monitor atmospheric dust density in **sandy terrain** at node **N18**.

## ⚙️ Operational Constraints

* **Rovers** should avoid traveling with less of 15% of energy.
* **Drones** are limited to short-duration missions and must return to their launch point after completing each survey.
* **Satellites** are required to periodically relay mission telemetry to the main base station.
* **All agents** must avoid regions affected by environmental instability or hazardous conditions.
